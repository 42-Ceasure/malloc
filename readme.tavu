what is this project ?

	This is a project from school, the goal is to implement malloc.
	There was no language requirements, but that sound legit for me
	to implement it in C.

to do next:

	rework realloc !!!

	better method for free to check ptr ?

	page that track alloc / or / heap adress ranges ?
	
	large gestion
	
	freepage ---> munmap

	find
	- implement find next fit
	- implement find best fit
	- implement find ...

munmap
sysconf
getrlimit
